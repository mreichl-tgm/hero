\section{Introduction}
The Hero Project is a \textbf{bullethell\footnotemark[1] roguelike\footnotemark[2] multiplayer\footnotemark[3] RPG\footnotemark[4]} providing a very own storytelling and gameplay experience.

\footnotetext[1]{A video game sub-genre where the screen is usually covered in bullets.}
\footnotetext[2]{A video game sub-genre which, based on the \href{http://roguebasin.com/roguelike-definition}{Roguebasin Interpretation}, is defined by 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Permanent Failure:} The player is encouraged to take responsibility for the risks he takes.
    \item \textbf{Procedural Environments:} Most of the game world is generated and provides complexity in resources and other elements of the game.
    \item \textbf{Resources:} The player can manage a limited amount of resources.
  \end{itemize}
  The \href{http://roguebasin.com/roguelike-definition}{Roguebasin}, \href{http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Berlin_Interpretation}{Berlin} and \href{http://roguetemple.com/roguelike-definition}{Roguetemple} Interpretation may give a more detailed explaination on this subject.

\footnotetext[3]{A multiplayer game allows but does not require clients to play together. The Hero Project is not meant to be played online only!}
\footnotetext[4]{A roleplay game is a game in which the player assumes the roles of characters in a fictional setting and takes responsibility for his acting either thorugh literal acting.}

It is highly inspired by previous titles in the roguelike and roleplay game genres, the most noteworthy being \href{https://realmofthemadgod.com}{Realm of the Mad God}, \href{http://www.devolverdigital.com/games/view/titan-souls}{Titan Souls} and \href{http://dodgeroll.com/gungeon/}{Enter the Gungeon}.

While all mentioned games are using a topdown pixelart setting The Hero Project is drawn in a very unique combination of high and low resolutions.
