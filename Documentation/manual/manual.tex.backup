      The Hero Project is a \textbf{bullethell roguelike multiplayer RPG} providing a very unique storytelling and gameplay experience.
      
      Its main goal as a school project is to create a solid base for a video game ready for further development. The core should be highly abstract, stable and easy to extend.

\section{Introduction}
The Hero Project is a \textbf{
  bullethell
  \footnote{A video game sub-genre where the screen is usually covered in bullets.}
  roguelike
  \footnote{A video game sub-genre which, based on the \href{http://roguebasin.com/roguelike-definition}{Roguebasin Interpretation}, is defined by 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Permanent Failure:} The player is encouraged to take responsibility for the risks he takes.
      \item \textbf{Procedural Environments:} Most of the game world is generated and provides complexity in resources and other elements of the game.
      \item \textbf{Resources:} The player can manage a limited amount of resources.
    \end{itemize}
    The \href{http://roguebasin.com/roguelike-definition}{Roguebasin}, \href{http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Berlin_Interpretation}{Berlin} and \href{http://roguetemple.com/roguelike-definition}{Roguetemple} Interpretation may give a more detailed explanation on this subject.

  multiplayer
  \footnote{A multiplayer game allows but does not require clients to play together. The Hero Project is not meant to be played online only!}
  RPG\footnote{A roleplay game is a game in which the player assumes the roles of characters in a fictional setting and takes responsibility for his acting either through literal acting.}
} providing a very unique storytelling and gameplay experience.

It is highly inspired by previous titles in the roguelike and roleplay game genres, the most noteworthy being \href{https://realmofthemadgod.com}{Realm of the Mad God}, \href{http://www.devolverdigital.com/games/view/titan-souls}{Titan Souls} and \href{http://dodgeroll.com/gungeon/}{Enter the Gungeon}.

While all mentioned games are using a topdown pixelart setting, the Hero Project is drawn in a very unique combination of high and low resolutions.

\section{Project Goals}
The main goal of The Hero Project as a school project is to create a solid base for a video game ready for further development.
This base includes all elements listed in the \textit{Functional} and \textit{Technical} Specifications sections found in the \textit{Functional Specifications} document.

\subsection{Targets}
\paragraph{Targets}
The team is going to provide a core game as mentioned earlier and also a prototype for presentation.
\paragraph{Non Targets}
The team is not thought to provide a demo version or even a complete game.

\newpage

\section{Team}
The Hero Projects core as a school project is developed by a static team of 4 members and 1 professor. All members are listed below followed by a short description including their role, responsibilities and contact information.
\paragraph{Djordjevic Filip} Sound Designer\\
Filip is responsible for all types of music and sound throughout the game.
\begin{description}
 \item Email: \href{mailto:fdjordjevic@student.tgm.ac.at}{fdjordjevic@student.tgm.ac.at}
\end{description}
\paragraph{Reichl Markus} Project Manager \textit{\small{(Product Owner)}}\\
Markus is both project manager and product owner. On development he provides concept art and is responsible for the system's architecture.
\begin{description}
 \item Email: \href{mailto:mreichl@student.tgm.ac.at}{mreichl@student.tgm.ac.at}
\end{description}
\paragraph{Tekin Abdurrahim} Artist\\
Burak provides art for both concept and production and is responsible for the aesthetics.
\begin{description}
 \item Email: \href{mailto:atekin@student.tgm.ac.at}{atekin@student.tgm.ac.at}
\end{description}
\paragraph{Wellner Florian} Software Developer\\
Florian is responsible for the software development process and helps out at pixelart.
\begin{description}
 \item Email: \href{mailto:fwellner@student.tgm.ac.at}{fwellner@student.tgm.ac.at}
\end{description}
~\\
The teams professor \textbf{Dolezal Dominik} acts as a supervisor and provides knowledge in all fields.
He also helps during development and in the project management process.

\section{Documentation Guidelines}
The Hero Project is using the v-Model\footnote{The V represents the sequence of steps in a project life cycle development. It describes the activities to be performed and the results that have to be produced during product development. In software development, the V-model represents a development process that may be considered an extension of the waterfall model.}, which requires the team to provide at least 2 documents.
\paragraph{Functional Specification} This document defines all features the product has to provide as a response to a \textit{Requirement Specification} document using the results of a feasibility study.
\paragraph{Project Manual} This document explains how the project, including all features found in the Functional Specification document, is realised by the team.

\subsection{Work Documentation}
Every person working on the project has to provide some documentation for every session including at least:
\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \textbf{Current date:} & \texttt{YY-MM-DD:} Title\\
 \textbf{Time spent:} & START: \texttt{00:00}\\
 & TIME SPENT: \texttt{0h 0m}\\
 \textbf{Description:} & A short description of this session

\section{Preconditions}
\subsection{General Preconditions}
\subsubsection{GitHub}
The whole development process of the project is managed using a private GitHub\footnote{GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service offering distributed version control and source code management.} repository.
In this case GitHub is also used in the project management process utilising \textit{Issues}\footnote{Issues are used to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for GitHub projects.} and \textit{Milestones}\footnote{A milestone acts like a container for issues. This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases.}.
Commits\footnote{A Git Commit records changes to a repository.} are used as development documentation.

\subsection{Technical Preconditions}
As seen in the projects feasibility study there have to be at least some technical conditions to the project. 

\subsubsection{Unity}
First of all the project is running on top of the Unity game engine using C\# as its main scripting language. 
Game elements are therefore implemented as Unity's \textit{Game Objects}\footnote{Base class for all entities in Unity.} and actions are realised as \textit{Mono Behaviours}\footnote{Base class from which every Script Component derives.}. 

When used correctly this pattern helps a lot with decoupling although it requires the core game to provide more concrete entities.
Another limitation is Unity's lacking support for generics, what makes using interfaces for behaviours a lot harder.
